üçÅ Qurench! is a space-themed web app that teaches Canadian English slang and Qu√©b√©cois French using cosmic flashcards and galactic multiple‚Äëchoice quizzes. It runs entirely in the browser with stellar animations and cosmic vibes.

The app presents cosmic "holocrons" (flashcards) with Canadian terms, meanings, examples, and fun facts. You can switch between Canadian English and Qu√©b√©cois French and explore categories like slang, food, weather, everyday phrases, and culture. The app generates a "Gauntlet" quiz that asks what each term means and tracks your score with stellar animations. There's also a cosmic companion that reacts to your answers and celebrates streaks with space-themed messages.

I built this because I enjoy the quirks of Canadian language and wanted a cosmic way to share them. This project was also a chance to practice stellar UX touches‚Äîlike space animations, flying elements, and cosmic feedback‚Äîthat make a simple tool feel like an interstellar adventure.

It's made with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with cosmic styling and space animations. The content lives in local JSON files under data/english and data/french, split into the categories above. Holocrons (flashcards) are rendered with cosmic flip animations and stellar navigation. The Gauntlet quiz is created on the fly by combining the correct meaning with believable distractors sampled from the dataset, then scoring with blast animations. The cosmic companion is a space-themed UI element that updates its message and expression based on correctness and streaks.

Along the way, I learned that sticking to static JSON keeps things simple, and that believable distractors make a big difference in how good a quiz feels. I also found that cosmic animations, flying elements, and space-themed feedback loops are worth the effort because they add stellar personality. Keeping the stack framework‚Äëfree made the project easy to maintain while adding cosmic flair.

To try it locally, clone or download the repository and open index.html in a modern browser. Here is the link if you want to try it online: https://gargipandeyy.github.io/Qurench/

If I continue this, I'd like to add cosmic favorites and custom holocron decks so you can build a personal stellar collection to study, more timed "Blizzard Blitz" modes for quick galactic challenges, cosmic badges like space helmets or constellation medals for milestones, and maybe planet‚Äëthemed powers or a cosmic map overlay to give interstellar flavor.

Built by Gargi Pandey and inspired by Canadian culture, everyday Qu√©bec French, and cosmic adventures. Have fun exploring the linguistic galaxies‚Äînice day out, eh? üá®üá¶ üöÄ
